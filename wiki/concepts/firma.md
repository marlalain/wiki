a concept I often explain to others is the idea of "firma". there's good fiction out there that creates practical examples about it, one of them being [Suits (2011)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suits_(American_TV_series)). even the opening song demonstrates a bit about this idea. 

> So working on a little job in the night\
It's forty dollars an hour when I see the light\
The boss is sayin' I look tired, I don't mind\
He'll be working in a small box 'til he die\
Me, I gotta be free all my life\
I want a little cream cheese in my pie

> Now I'm putting on a big wig, walking hard\
Hanging with them big pigs, all them dogs\
Got me a couple ideas straight from God\
I want a bean pie, order me a bean pie\
I'll even eat a beehive, I don't mind\
Me and Missy is so very busy, busy making money
